# CaseCraft-Template

Hello.
This template was designed by me as a task when I was looking for an internship. I didn't go ahead with it due to personal reasons. The layout looked pretty good from the outside and helped me grasp a lots of concepts.  
<hr>
I made this layout from scratch using Bootstrap Studios.  

## Highlights
- Too much bad code, first and foremost
- Is compatible only on full-sized screens
- Not responsive (my bad)
- Just for fun :))
